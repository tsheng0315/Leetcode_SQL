## 596. Classes More Than 5 Students

### SQL Schema
```mysql
Create table If Not Exists courses (student varchar(255), class varchar(255))
Truncate table courses
insert into courses (student, class) values ('A', 'Math')
insert into courses (student, class) values ('B', 'English')
insert into courses (student, class) values ('C', 'Math')
insert into courses (student, class) values ('D', 'Biology')
insert into courses (student, class) values ('E', 'Math')
insert into courses (student, class) values ('F', 'Computer')
insert into courses (student, class) values ('G', 'Math')
insert into courses (student, class) values ('H', 'Math')
insert into courses (student, class) values ('I', 'Math')
```

There is a table `courses` with columns: `student` and `class`

list all classes which have >= 5 students.
```
For example, the table:
+---------+------------+
| student | class      |
+---------+------------+
| A       | Math       |
| B       | English    |
| C       | Math       |
| D       | Biology    |
| E       | Math       |
| F       | Computer   |
| G       | Math       |
| H       | Math       |
| I       | Math       |
+---------+------------+
Should output:
+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+
 
Note: students should not be counted duplicate in each course.
