### 626. Exchange Seats

#### SQL Schema
```mysql
Create table If Not Exists seat(id int, student varchar(255))
Truncate table seat
insert into seat (id, student) values ('1', 'Abbot')
insert into seat (id, student) values ('2', 'Doris')
insert into seat (id, student) values ('3', 'Emerson')
insert into seat (id, student) values ('4', 'Green')
insert into seat (id, student) values ('5', 'Jeames')
```


Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table seat storing students' names and their corresponding seat ids.
The column id is continuous increment.
 

Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.

Write a SQL query to output the result for Mary.
 
```mysql
+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Abbot   |
|    2    | Doris   |
|    3    | Emerson |
|    4    | Green   |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
For the sample input, the output is:
 

+---------+---------+
|    id   | student |
+---------+---------+
|    1    | Doris   |
|    2    | Abbot   |
|    3    | Green   |
|    4    | Emerson |
|    5    | Jeames  |
+---------+---------+
```

Note:
If the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one's seat.

### mycode
wrong one--the useage of max()--should be in a select sentence
```mysql

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select 
(case 
 when id!=max(id) and id%2!=0 then id+1
 when id!=max(id) and id%2=0 then id-1 
 else id
 end) as id,student
 
from seat

```
right one

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select
(case 
 when id!=(select max(id) from seat) and id%2!=0 then id+1
 when id!=(select max(id) from seat) and id%2=0 then id-1 
 else id
 end) as id,student
 
from seat
order by id
```
