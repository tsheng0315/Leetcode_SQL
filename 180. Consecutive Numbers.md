### 180. Consecutive Numbers

#### SQL schema
```mysql
Create table If Not Exists Logs (Id int, Num int)
Truncate table Logs
insert into Logs (Id, Num) values ('1', '1')
insert into Logs (Id, Num) values ('2', '1')
insert into Logs (Id, Num) values ('3', '1')
insert into Logs (Id, Num) values ('4', '2')
insert into Logs (Id, Num) values ('5', '1')
insert into Logs (Id, Num) values ('6', '2')
insert into Logs (Id, Num) values ('7', '2')
```

```
Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |
+----+-----+
For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
```

### idea
1. use **windows function** select records that have 3 consecutive numbers ==> form a hidden table
2. select distinct records from the new hidden table

### mycode 不会
* **Windows functions** to the rescue. Though this solution is slower for smaller tables, it will work better for larger tables.
* **lag(),lead()**

 **lag()** 
* calculate the difference between the current and one previous record.
https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-window-functions/mysql-lag-function/

```mysql
LAG(<expression>[,offset[, default_value]]) OVER (
    PARTITION BY expr,...
    ORDER BY expr [ASC|DESC],...
)
```

`expression`
* The LAG() function returns `expression` from precedes the current row by offset number of rows,  within its partition set.

`offset`
* Gap, LAG() uses 1 by default.

`default_value`
* fail to find the row ==>returns the default_value. 
* returns NULL by default.

`PARTITION BY`
* Divide the rows in the result set into partitions to which the LAG() function is applied. 
 LAG() considers the whole result set as a single partition by default.

`ORDER BY`
* Specifies the order of rows in each partition before the LAG() is applied.


 **lead()**
* calculate the difference between the current and one following record.

solution 1
```mysql
SELECT distinct num ConsecutiveNums
FROM
(SELECT id, num,
lag(num,1) over (order by id) as before,
lead(num,1) over (order by id) as after
FROM logs) as next_prev
WHERE num=before and before =after
```
solution 2
```mysql
SELECT distinct num as ConsecutiveNums
FROM
(SELECT id, num,
lead(num,1) over (order by id) as second,
lead(num,2) over (order by id) as third
FROM logs) as next_prev
WHERE num=second and second=third
```
solution 3
```mysql
with cte as (SELECT
Num,
LEAD(Num,1) over (order by id) as second,
LEAD(Num,2) over (order by id) as third
from
logs)

select distinct Num as ConsecutiveNums
from cte
where Num = second and second= third
```
