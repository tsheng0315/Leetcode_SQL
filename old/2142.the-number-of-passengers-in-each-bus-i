# Write your MySQL query statement below

# with cte as (select  b.bus_id,  b.arrival_time as b_time, p.passenger_id , p.arrival_time as p_time,
# rank() over(partition by p.passenger_id order by  b.arrival_time ) as rk
# from Buses b 
#    right join Passengers p
#     on p.arrival_time <= b.arrival_time),

# c2 as (select bus_id,  passenger_id
# from cte c
#     where c.rk =1)

# select b.bus_id, count(c2.passenger_id) as passengers_cnt
# from c2 right join Buses b on c2.bus_id = b.bus_id
# group by b.bus_id
# order by b.bus_id


# select passenger - right bus pair
with cte as (select p.passenger_id, min(b.arrival_time) as bus_time
from buses b join Passengers p 
    on p.arrival_time <= b.arrival_time
    group by p.arrival_time)

#再把passenger 对应到每辆车里
select b.bus_id,
count(c.passenger_id) as passengers_cnt  # count里的内容不能随便count,会不一样
from Buses b
    left join cte c 
    on b.arrival_time = c.bus_time
    group by b.bus_id

# 思路要清晰啊
