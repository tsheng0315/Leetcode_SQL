# Write your MySQL query statement below

#         when income< 20000 then 'Low Salary' 
#         when 20000<= income and income <= 50000 then 'Low Salary' 
#         else 'High Salary'
#         end as category
# from Accounts)

# select category,
# count(*) as accounts_count
# from cte
# group by category

# 原表中没有Average Salary的相关记录, 最后的outcome里要有Average Salary 0的字样 -> 用union all制造出来

select 
    'Low Salary' as  category,
    sum(income< 20000) as accounts_count 
from Accounts 
    
union all

select 
    'Average Salary' as  category,
    sum(income>= 20000 and income <= 50000) as accounts_count 
from Accounts 

union all

select 
    'High Salary' as  category,
    sum(income>50000) as accounts_count
from Accounts 


# sum() 列值为空返回null，count()为空时为0;
# select 
#     'High Salary' as  category,
#     count(income>50000) as accounts_count
# from Accounts 
# where account_id = 10

# count(条件)不会对条件做判断，有record就count+1
# sum(条件)会对条件做判断，满足条件+1，else +0
