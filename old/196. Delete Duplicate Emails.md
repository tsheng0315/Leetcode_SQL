### 196. Delete Duplicate Emails

Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named `Person`, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest `Id`.
```
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Id is the primary key column for this table.
For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have the following rows:

+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Note:
Your output is the whole Person table after executing your sql. Use delete statement.
```
### my solution
1. select duplicate emails
2. find max Id that need to remove -- later proved to be wrong(run right, submit wrong) 
/ 2. find the min id that need to keep -- right one


### my code
#### Failed 1:
```mysql
select Id,Email from Person where (count(Email)>1)  # where can't be follwed by function
```

#### Failed 2
 ##### You can't specify target table 'Person' for update in FROM clause ",
```mysql
delete FROM Person 
where exists
(select Id,Email
from Person     # wrong
group by Email
having count(email)>1
order by Id Desc)
```

#### Failed 3
run:  empty table
```mysql
delete FROM Person 
where exists  # new error
(select Id,Email
from (SELECT * FROM Person ) AS PersonB   # create a new table called PersonB
group by Email
having count(email)>1
order by Id Desc)
```

`IN`:
* Typically used to filter a column for a certain list of values.

`EXISTS`:
* EXISTS only evaluates whether or not there is a result at all(True/False)
* Typically, a subquery is used in conjunction with EXISTS. It actually doesn't matter what the subquery returns, as long as rows are returned.



#### Failed 4 
Run success, test wrong: just deleted the max Id, if one email occupies multiple Ids, it won't work.
```mysql
delete FROM Person 
where Id in  # correct the new error

(select max(Id) as Id
from (SELECT * FROM Person ) AS PersonB
group by Email
having count(email)>1
order by Id Desc)
```

#### Succeed 1
faster than 36.77%
```mysql
delete FROM Person 
where id not in

(select min(Id) as Id
from (SELECT * FROM Person ) AS PersonB
group by Email
order by Id Desc)
```
#### Succeed 2
other's: faster than 10%
```mysql
delete p1
from person p1, person p2
where p1.Email=p2.Email and p1.Id>p2.Id
```

#### Succeed 3
other's: faster than 50%
```mysql
DELETE p1
From Person p1
JOIN Person p2
WHERE
    p1.id > p2.id AND
    p1.Email = p2.Email
```
* To delete rows from **both T1 and T2** tables:
```mysql
DELETE T1, T2
FROM T1
INNER JOIN T2 
ON T1.key = T2.key
WHERE condition;
```

* To delete rows from just T1 and **NOT** T2 tables:
```mysql
DELETE T1
FROM T1
INNER JOIN T2 
ON T1.key = T2.key
WHERE condition;
```
