# Write your MySQL query statement below

with cte as (
select
    order_id,
    avg(quantity) as avg_n,
    max(quantity) as max_n
from OrdersDetails
group by order_id)

select
order_id
from cte
where max_n > 
    (select max(avg_n) from cte )


# where要这么包一下
# where max_n > 
#     (select max(avg_n) from cte )

# select 
# order_id
# from cte
# having max_n > max(avg_n)

# where 是对每条record逐行筛选
# having是对整个group做筛选
# having后跟的column需要在select中先select出来, where不用
