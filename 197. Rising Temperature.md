### 197. Rising Temperature

#### SQL schema
```mysql
Create table If Not Exists Weather (Id int, RecordDate date, Temperature int)
Truncate table Weather
insert into Weather (Id, RecordDate, Temperature) values ('1', '2015-01-01', '10')
insert into Weather (Id, RecordDate, Temperature) values ('2', '2015-01-02', '25')
insert into Weather (Id, RecordDate, Temperature) values ('3', '2015-01-03', '20')
insert into Weather (Id, RecordDate, Temperature) values ('4', '2015-01-04', '30')
```

Table: `Weather`
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature in a certain day.
 
Write an SQL query to find all dates' id with higher temperature compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

Weather
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | Temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+

Result table:
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
In 2015-01-02, temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, temperature was higher than the previous day (30 -> 20).
```

### Idea
1. use windows function,lead() to compare consecutive numbers
2. 

### my code
**failed 1**
* run succeed, test failed
```mysql
select id+1 as id
from 

(select id, temperature,
lead(temperature) over (order by Id) as second
from weather ) as selected

where temperature < second 
```
run: 
```mysql
{"headers": {"Weather": ["Id", "RecordDate", "Temperature"]}, "rows": {"Weather": [[1, "2015-01-01", 10], [2, "2015-01-02", 25], [3, "2015-01-03", 20], [4, "2015-01-04", 30]]}}
```
test_input:
```mysql
{"headers": {"Weather": ["Id", "RecordDate", "Temperature"]}, "rows": {"Weather": [[1, "2000-12-16", 3], [2, "2000-12-15", -1]]}}
```
test_output:
```mysql
{"headers": ["id"], "values": [[3]]}
```

This means we can't use `id` as order, because not always the date is ranked by id, we should use `recordDate` to ensure the date is ranked in date order.
