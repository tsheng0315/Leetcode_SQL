### 197. Rising Temperature

#### SQL schema
```mysql
Create table If Not Exists Weather (Id int, RecordDate date, Temperature int)
Truncate table Weather
insert into Weather (Id, RecordDate, Temperature) values ('1', '2015-01-01', '10')
insert into Weather (Id, RecordDate, Temperature) values ('2', '2015-01-02', '25')
insert into Weather (Id, RecordDate, Temperature) values ('3', '2015-01-03', '20')
insert into Weather (Id, RecordDate, Temperature) values ('4', '2015-01-04', '30')
```

Table: `Weather`
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature in a certain day.
 
Write an SQL query to find all dates' id with higher temperature compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

Weather
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | Temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+

Result table:
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
In 2015-01-02, temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, temperature was higher than the previous day (30 -> 20).
```

### Idea
1. use windows function,lag()/lead() to compare consecutive numbers
2.  create 2 tables and 

### my code
**succeed 1**
* windows function lag()
```mysql
select id 
from 
(select id,
 lag(Temperature) over (order by recordDate) as before
from weather) as pre_today
where Temperature>before
```
**failed 1**
* run succeed, test failed
```mysql
select id+1 as id
from 

(select id, temperature,
lead(temperature) over (order by Id) as second
from weather ) as selected

where temperature < second 
```
run: 
```mysql
{"headers": {"Weather": ["Id", "RecordDate", "Temperature"]}, "rows": {"Weather": [[1, "2015-01-01", 10], [2, "2015-01-02", 25], [3, "2015-01-03", 20], [4, "2015-01-04", 30]]}}
```
test_input:
```mysql
{"headers": {"Weather": ["Id", "RecordDate", "Temperature"]}, "rows": {"Weather": [[1, "2000-12-16", 3], [2, "2000-12-15", -1]]}}
```
test_output:
```mysql
{"headers": ["id"], "values": [[3]]}
```

This means we can't use `id` as order, because not always the date is ranked by id, we should use `recordDate` to ensure the date is ranked in date order.

**Succeed 2**
* create 2 layers of hidden table,use **date_add()**
`date_add(date, interval 1 day)`
```mysql
select id from weather 
where recordDate in (

select higherdate from 
(
select id, recordDate, Temperature, DATE_ADD(recordDate,INTERVAL 1 day) as higherdate,
 lead(Temperature) over (order by recordDate) as second
from weather) as today_post
where Temperature<second)
```
**succeed 3**
*  use **duplicate tables**, **date_add()**
```mysql
select w1.id
from weather w1, weather w2
where w1.Temperature>w2.Temperature and w1.recordDate=date_add(w2.recordDate,interval 1 day)
```

**others'**
* use **inner join+on** + **to_days()**  93.54% 
```mysql
SELECT w1.Id
FROM Weather w1
INNER JOIN Weather w2
ON TO_DAYS(w1.Date) = TO_DAYS(w2.Date) + 1
WHERE w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature
```

**others'**
* use **duplicate tables** & **and** & **TO_DAYS()**
```mysql
SELECT wt1.Id 
FROM Weather wt1, Weather wt2
WHERE wt1.Temperature > wt2.Temperature AND 
      TO_DAYS(wt1.DATE)-TO_DAYS(wt2.DATE)=1;
 ```
