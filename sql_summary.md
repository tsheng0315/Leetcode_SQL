## regexp `^`

Putting a `^` inside the closed bracket means make it match all characters EXCEPT the ones inside the bracket. 

So instead of writing [bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz], we can write [^aeiou]

##  regexp `.`, `*`
* `.` is representing one character 
* `..` is representing two characters and so on 
* `.*` is representing as many characters u want
